CoW scheme
- Snapshots are just pointers to root nodes
- Conceptually, nodes are addressed by an arbitrary node ID (which counts up sequentially)
- For locality, we prepend IDs by the index in the tree
- We build up the tree for a new epoch in-memory:
	- We lazy-load nodes that are accessed
	- Set() only touches changed nodes (nodes store childHashes so sibling nodes are not accessed), so all in-memory nodes are considered dirty
	- Flush() writes out loaded nodes and returns the new snapshot number


Questions
- Implement in purely functional style? (Probably still don't want to expose API
  that way)
	- Due to inertia I won't right now
- Only set node IDs upon flush?
- Cache nodes in-memory? Currently we do not (but LevelDB caches)
	- Would have to add a dirty bit so flush() doesn't write out all the cached nodes
- Use binary encoding library rather than hand-serialization?
- Support deletion?
	- Currently the lazy-loading logic breaks this

Comments
- Would be even nicer if you couldn't get access to a new snapshot number until
  the writebatch was flushed
- Confusion about nodes being nil because they're not loaded vs they're actually
  not present
- Confusion about when what is nil in proto.TreeProof
- Trace construction very brittle (magically depends on lookup code)

Hashing
0. Take CONIKS scheme
1. Add identifier for internal nodes (and maybe path, like Joe suggested?)
2. Commitment -> just hash of Entry (Profile includes nonce; our VRF hashes in
	the name so we don't have to worry about collisions)
